- Lone Block

Made in less than a month as a personal challenge, Lone Block is a survival sandbox game with crafting mechanics. The player can harvest, plant food and build structures on the map. Part of the challenge was to use only pixels (no sprites) and limiting myself to only 16 colors.

After the initial development month, other updates were made to the game, adding enemies and improving crafting mechanics.
